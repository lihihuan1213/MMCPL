#  MMCPL: Multimodal Embedding Enhancement for Concept Prerequisite Learning

<img src="./MMCPL.png" style="zoom:67%;" />

In this paper, we proposed MMCPL, a multimodal embedding enhancement method, to address the limitations of unimodal text modeling for Concept Prerequisite Learning. Our  approach integrated textual and image modalities of concepts. Specifically, by leveraging a cross-modal attention mechanism and a dual-branch contrastive learning strategy,  the method facilitated deep inter-modal interaction. This design effectively mitigated background noise in images and enhanced the discriminative power of concept representations.
